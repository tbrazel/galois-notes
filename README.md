# Notes on Galois theory in enumerative geometry

Notes from a [minicourse](https://tbrazel.github.io/flash2) on Galois groups of enumerative problems, following Joe Harris' 1979 paper of the same name. Notes are in rough shape but slowly improving, please suggest changes by emailing or submitting a pull request.

We also are slowly building up a [repository of visualizations](https://github.com/tbrazel/galois_visualizations) in enumerative geometry and Galois theory. Check it out!
